# Introduction 
The Northwind Traders dataset is a database that imitates a companyâ€™s business processes. This project explores my proficiency in analytics, drawing actionable insights and present it in a visually compelling manner. In this project, I analyzed sales, customers, employees, products, and shippers using Excel and PowerBI. The primary aim is to derive insights that support business decisions by identifying trends and patterns within the dataset. 

## Tools Used

**Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis.

**Microsoft Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following tables:

**Orders**: Information about order transactions, including Order ID, Customer ID, Employee ID, Order Date, and Shipped Date.

**Customers**: Details of customers, such as Customer ID, Company Name, Contact Name, Contact title, and Address.

**Products**: Product catalog with Product ID, Product Name, Category ID, and Unit Price.  

**Shippers**: Information about shipping companies used for fulfilling orders.

**Employees**: Employee data including Employee ID, Name, Title, City, and Country. 



## Key Objectives

- To understand sales performance across different regions, product categories, and time periods.

- To identify top-performing products and customers.

- To evaluate employee contributions to sales.

- Analyze shipping performance to ensure timely delivery.

- Create interactive dashboards to communicate insights effectively.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning (Excel)

**Checked for missing data:** Identified and filled in missing values where applicable (e.g., missing shipment dates).

**Formatting inconsistencies:** Standardized date formats, text cases, and numeric formats.

**Data relationships:** Verified the relationships between tables for accurate joins.

**Advanced Excel Functions:** Used advanced functions like VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, and conditional formatting to efficiently retrieve and match data across multiple tables, and highlight key trends, outliers, and critical insights. 

**Pivot Tables:** Generated summary tables to identify preliminary patterns.

### Data Modeling (Power BI)

Imported cleaned Excel data into Power BI.

Established relationships between tables using keys.

Defined measures and applied filters to analyze and visualize data based on specific criteria.

Created calculated columns and measures for advanced analysis (e.g., Total Sales, Average Delivery Time).

## Dashboard Development

**Key Metrics:** Total sales, total transactions, total customers, total shipping cost, total quantity sold, total products shipped, top products and products category, best customers, discounts, monthly and yearly sales trends.  


**Visuals:** Bar charts, line charts, and KPIs.
